# Rashi's lisp-postfix interpreter

You can get started by doing `npm start`. That will run the REPL.

Please note there is no syntax checking, so be careful. Also, all symbols need to be escaped, (unless they are not defined), because they will otherwise be interpreted as their value.

You may run my tests my doing `npm test`
